# Pokemon Terminal Catching game. -Final_Project-CodeAcademy-CS101
This is a simple catching game that generates random encounters with random levels and accurate stats based on the pokemon's data.

Roadmap:
[ ] **New dataset using pokéapi** - To enable evolutions and accurately leveling based on exp stats.
[ ] **Discord.py** - Turning the game into a fully working discord bot

##### **on hold while building a my own data set using pokéapi and studying db's**
